""" **Instructions to Follow (Failing to follow these will result mark deductions).**

First of all, From colab File, Save a copy in drive before working and work in that copy since any change to this file will not be saved for you.

You can not use any built-in function except len()

You can not use any other python collections except array (e.g: tuple, dictionaries etc.).

We will initialize a new array using numpy library. We have to mention the fixed size during initialization. There might be 4 approaches.

i. arr = np.array([None] * 10) #Initializing an array length 10 with values None.

ii. arr = np.array([0] * 10) #Initializing an array length 10 with values zero.

iii. arr = np.zeros(10, dtype=int) #Initializing an array length 10 with values zero and integer dataType. By default, dtype is float.

iv. arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40]) #Initializing an array length 4 with the values.
